# Introduction to InSpec Resources and Matchers
  
[Back to the Lab Index](../README.md#cooking-up-compliance---workshop)
  
### Resources
The following list of InSpec resources are available for:  
 - Operating Systems like Linux and Windows
 - Containers
 - AWS
 - Azure
 - GCP
 - Habitat

A full list can be found [here](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/resources/)
  

### Matchers
Chef InSpec uses matchers to help compare resource values to expectations.  
  
The following InSpec-supported universal matchers are available:  

`be` - make numeric comparisons  
`be_in` - look for the property value in a list  
`cmp` - general-use equality (try this first)  
`eq` - type-specific equality  
`include` - look for an expected value in a list-valued property  
`match` - look for patterns in text using regular expressions  
  
### be
This matcher can be followed by many different comparison operators. Always make sure to use numbers, not strings, for these comparisons.  
  
```ruby
describe file('/proc/cpuinfo') do
  its('size') { should be >= 10 }
  its('size') { should be < 1000 }
end
```
  
### cmp
Unlike eq, cmp is a matcher for less-restrictive comparisons. It will try to fit the actual value to the type you are comparing it to. This is meant to relieve the user from having to write type-casts and resolutions.  
   
```ruby
describe sshd_config do
  its('Protocol') { should cmp 2 }
end

describe passwd.uid(0) do
  its('users') { should cmp 'root' }
end
```
`cmp` behaves in the following way:  
  
Compare strings to numbers  
```ruby
describe sshd_config do
  # Only `'2'` works
  its('Protocol') { should eq '2' }

  # Both of these work
  its('Protocol') { should cmp '2' }
  its('Protocol') { should cmp 2 }
end
```
  
String comparisons are not case-sensitive  
```ruby
describe auditd_conf do
  its('log_format') { should cmp 'raw' }
  its('log_format') { should cmp 'RAW' }
end
```
Recognize versions embedded in strings  
```ruby
describe package('curl') do
  its('version') { should cmp > '7.35.0-1ubuntu2.10' }
end
```
Compare arrays with only one entry to a value  
```ruby
describe passwd.uids(0) do
  its('users') { should cmp 'root' }
  its('users') { should cmp ['root'] }
end
```
Single-value arrays of strings may also be compared to a regex  
```ruby
describe auditd_conf do
  its('log_format') { should cmp /raw/i }
end
```
Improved printing of octal comparisons  
```ruby
describe file('/proc/cpuinfo') do
  its('mode') { should cmp '0345' }
end

expected: 0345
got: 0444
```
  
### eq
Test for exact equality of two values.  
  
```ruby  
describe sshd_config do
  its('RSAAuthentication') { should_not eq 'no' }
  its('Protocol') { should eq '2' }
end
```
`eq` fails if types donâ€™t match. Please keep this in mind, when comparing configuration entries that are numbers:  
  
```ruby  
its('Port') { should eq '22' } # ok

its('Port') { should eq 22 }
# fails: '2' != 2 (string vs int)
```
For less restrictive comparisons, please use cmp.  

### include
Verifies if a value is included in a list.  
  
```ruby
describe passwd do
  its('users') { should include 'my_user' }
end
```
  
### be_in
Verifies that an item is included in a list.  
  
```ruby
describe resource do
  its('item') { should be_in LIST }
end
```
  
### match
Check if a string matches a regular expression.  
  
```ruby
describe sshd_config do
  its('Ciphers') { should_not match /cbc/ }
end
```
