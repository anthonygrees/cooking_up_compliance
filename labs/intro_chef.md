[Back to the Lab Index](../README.md#cooking-up-compliance---workshop)
  
### About Chef ?
Chef can automate how you build, deploy, and manage your infrastructure.
  
Chef can integrate with infrastructure and cloud platforms to automatically provision and configure new machines such as:
- Bare Metal
- VMware
- Hyper-V
- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud
- AliCloud
- Docker
  
Chef is a large set of tools that are able to be used on multiple platforms and in numerous configurations. 
  
Learning Chef is like learning a language. You will learn the basic concepts very fast but it will take practice until you become comfortable.
  
A great way to learn Chef is to use Chef !
  
### What actually is Chef ?
Chef is....
- An automation framework that enables Infrastructure as Code
- A robust set of tooling for testing Chef code
- A large library of reusable patterns (supermarket.chef.io)
- Available for Linux variants, Unix variants, and Windows, all as first class citizens.
  
### DSL - Domain Specific Language
Chef is a DSL
- Programmatically provision and configure components
- Declarative DSL with the flexibility 
- Built on Ruby
- Extensible through Ruby
  
therefore you treat it like any programing language and ensure Chef is:
